During the unloading truck event, the package location can be either at the unloading location or inside the truck. Unloading a package from an airplane is possible if the package and the airplane are in the same location. During the unloading airplane event, the package location can be either at the unloading location or inside the airplane.

Multiple packages can be loaded onto or unloaded from a truck simultaneously, but loading and unloading cannot occur at the same time.

Driving a truck is possible only if the source and destination locations are in the same city. During the driving event, the package location is in the truck. Flying an airplane is possible only if the source and destination locations are in different cities. During the flying event, the package location is in the airplane. Multiple packages can be loaded onto or unloaded from a truck simultaneously, but loading and unloading cannot occur at the same time.
