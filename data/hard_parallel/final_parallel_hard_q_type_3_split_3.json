Unloading a package from an airplane is possible if the package and the airplane are in the same location. During the unloading airplane event, the package location can be either at the unloading location or inside the airplane. Driving a truck is possible only if the source and destination locations are in the same city. During the driving event, the package location is in the truck. Flying an airplane is possible only if the source and destination locations are in different cities. During the flying event, the package location is in the airplane. Multiple packages can be loaded onto or unloaded from a truck simultaneously, but loading and unloading cannot occur at the same time. Similarly, multiple packages can be loaded or unloaded simultaneously from an airplane, but simultaneous loading and unloading are not permitted. When a truck reaches a new location, unloading of packages must occur before loading new packages. When an airplane arrives at a new location, unloading of packages must occur before loading new packages. If any event is delayed or expedited, all subsequent dependent events are also delayed or expedited accordingly.",
