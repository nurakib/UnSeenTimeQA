Unloading a package from an airplane is possible if the package and the airplane are in the same location. During the unloading airplane event, the package location can be either at the unloading location or inside the airplane. Driving a truck is possible only if the source and destination locations are in the same city. During the driving event, the package location is in the truck. Flying an airplane is possible only if the source and destination locations are in different cities. During the flying event, the package location is in the airplane. Packages can be loaded onto or unloaded from a truck simultaneously, but loading and unloading cannot occur at the same time. Similarly, multiple packages can be loaded or unloaded simultaneously from an airplane, but simultaneous loading and unloading are not permitted. When a truck reaches a new location, unloading of packages must occur before loading new products.

Unloading a package from a truck is possible if the package and the truck are in the same location. During the unloading truck event, the package location can be either at the unloading location or inside the truck. Unloading a package from an airplane is possible if the package and the airplane are in the same location. During the unloading airplane event, the package location can be either at the unloading location or inside the airplane. Driving a truck is possible only if the source and destination locations are in the same city. During the driving event, the package location is in the truck. Flying an airplane is possible only if the source and destination locations are in different cities. During the flying event, the package location is in the airplane. Packages can be loaded onto or unloaded from a truck simultaneously, but loading and unloading cannot occur at the same time. Similarly, multiple packages can be loaded or unloaded simultaneously from an airplane, but simultaneous loading and unloading are not permitted. When a truck reaches a new location, unloading of packages must occur before loading new products. When an airplane arrives at a new location, unloading of packages must occur before loading new products.",

During the loading truck event, the package location can be either at the loading location or inside the truck. Loading a package in an airplane is possible if the package and the airplane are in the same location. During the loading airplane event, the package location can be either at the loading location or inside the airplane. Unloading a package from a truck is possible if the package and the truck are in the same location. During the unloading truck event, the package location can be either at the unloading location or inside the truck. Unloading a package from an airplane is possible if the package and the airplane are in the same location. During the unloading airplane event, the package location can be either at the unloading location or inside the airplane. Driving a truck is possible only if the source and destination locations are in the same city. During the driving event, the package location is in the truck. Flying an airplane is possible only if the source and destination locations are in different cities. During the flying event, the package location is in the airplane. Packages can be loaded onto or unloaded from a truck simultaneously, but loading and unloading cannot occur at the same time. Similarly, multiple packages can be loaded or unloaded simultaneously from an airplane, but simultaneous loading and unloading are not permitted. When a truck reaches a new location, unloading of packages must occur before loading new products. When an airplane arrives at a new location, unloading of packages must occur before loading new products.",
