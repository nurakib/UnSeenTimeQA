This paper introduces UnSeenTimeQA, a novel data contamination-free time-sensitive question-answering (TSQA) benchmark. It differs from existing TSQA benchmarks by avoiding web-searchable queries grounded in the real-world. We present a series of time-sensitive event scenarios based on synthetically generated facts. It requires large language models (LLMs) to engage in genuine temporal reasoning without depending on the factual knowledge acquired during the pre-training phase. We designed three types of time-sensitive questions to test LLMs' temporal reasoning abilities over sequential and parallel event occurrences. Our evaluation of five LLMs on synthetic fact-based TSQA reveals mixed results: while they perform well on simpler subsets, their overall performance remains inferior as compared to real-world fact-based TSQA. Error analysis of LLM-generated reasoning chains indicates that LLMs face difficulties in reasoning over long-range event dependencies and parallel event timelines that unfold concurrently.

Different types of events (six) from the UnSeenTimeQA benchmark. The benchmark is structured into
four difficulty levels: easy, medium, hard (serial), and hard (parallel). In the easy level, the start (S) and end (E)
times of each event are given. The medium level includes the start time (S) and duration (D) of each event. The hard
(serial) level presents only the duration (D) of events, assuming sequential occurrence. The hard (parallel) level also
includes only durations (D), but events can occur simultaneously. Pictures (top), drawn by DALL-E 3.
